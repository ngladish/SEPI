# Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)

The SVI is an index which measures how vulnerable a community is to a natural disaster. ATSDR’s Geospatial Research, Analysis, & Services Program (GRASP) created the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Social Vulnerability Index (hereafter, CDC/ATSDR SVI or SVI) to help public health officials and emergency response planners identify and map the communities that will most likely need support before, during, and after a hazardous event at each census tract. The degree to which a community exhibits certain social conditions, including high poverty, low percentage of vehicle access, or crowded households, among others, may affect that community’s ability to prevent human suffering and financial loss in the event of a disaster. These factors describe a community’s social vulnerability. SVI ranks the tracts on 16 social factors, such as unemployment, racial and ethnic minority status, and disability status. Then, SVI further groups the factors into four related themes. Thus, each tract receives a ranking for each Census variable and for each of the four themes as well as an overall ranking.

SVI data can be downloaded from their [website](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/place-health/php/svi/svi-data-documentation-download.html) at the census tract and county levels for years [2000](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/place-health/media/pdfs/2024/08/SVI2000Documentation-H.pdf), [2010](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/place-health/media/pdfs/2024/08/SVI-2010-Documentation-H.pdf), [2014](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/place-health/media/pdfs/2024/08/SVI2014Documentation_01192022_1.pdf), [2016](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/place-health/media/pdfs/2024/08/SVI2016Documentation_01192022.pdf), [2018](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/place-health/media/pdfs/2024/08/SVI2018Documentation_01192022_1.pdf), [2020](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/place-health/media/pdfs/2024/08/SVI2020Documentation_08.05.22.pdf), and [2022](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/place-health/media/pdfs/2024/10/SVI2022Documentation.pdf). It is exported as a rank from 0 to 1 and the SVI can be exported based on nationwide ranking or statewide ranking as well. There are four themes and each have a set of previously defined variables required. Percentile ranking values range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating greater vulnerability.
